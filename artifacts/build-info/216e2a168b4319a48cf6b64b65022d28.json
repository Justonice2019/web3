Storage slots are often used to avoid storage conflict when dealing with upgradeable contracts. This library helps with reading and writing to such slots without the need for inline assembly. The functions in this library return Slot structs that contain a `value` member that can be used to read or write. Example usage to set ERC-1967 implementation slot: ```solidity contract ERC1967 {     // Define the slot. Alternatively, use the SlotDerivation library to derive the slot.     bytes32 internal constant _IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT = 0x360894a13ba1a3210667c828492db98dca3e2076cc3735a920a3ca505d382bbc;     function _getImplementation() internal view returns (address) {         return StorageSlot.getAddressSlot(_IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT).value;     }     function _setImplementation(address newImplementation) internal {         require(newImplementation.code.length > 0);         StorageSlot.getAddressSlot(_IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT).value = newImplementation;     } } ``` TIP: Consider using this library along with {SlotDerivation}.\",\"kind\":\"dev\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1},\"userdoc\":{\"kind\":\"user\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1}},\"settings\":{\"compilationTarget\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/StorageSlot.sol\":\"StorageSlot\"},\"evmVersion\":\"prague\",\"libraries\":{},\"metadata\":{\"bytecodeHash\":\"ipfs\"},\"optimizer\":{\"enabled\":false,\"runs\":200},\"remappings\":[]},\"sources\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/StorageSlot.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xcf74f855663ce2ae00ed8352666b7935f6cddea2932fdf2c3ecd30a9b1cd0e97\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://9f660b1f351b757dfe01438e59888f31f33ded3afcf5cb5b0d9bf9aa6f320a8b\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmarDJ5hZEgBtCmmrVzEZWjub9769eD686jmzb2XpSU1cM\"]}},\"version\":1}",

								"text": " @dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed\n behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an\n external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer\n function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.\n The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be\n reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each \"step\" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in\n case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.\n For example:\n [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\n ```solidity\n contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {\n     function initialize() initializer public {\n         __ERC20_init(\"MyToken\", \"MTK\");\n     }\n }\n contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {\n     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {\n         __ERC20Permit_init(\"MyToken\");\n     }\n }\n ```\n TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as\n possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.\n CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure\n that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.\n [CAUTION]\n ====\n Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.\n An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation\n contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke\n the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:\n [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\n ```\n /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor\n constructor() {\n     _disableInitializers();\n }\n ```\n ===="

In its scope, `onlyInitializing` functions can be\n used to initialize parent contracts.\n A reinitializer may be used after the original initialization step. This is essential to configure modules that\n are added through upgrades and that require initialization.\n When `version` is 1, this modifier is similar to `initializer`, except that functions marked with `reinitializer`\n cannot be nested. If one is invoked in the context of another, execution will revert.\n Note that versions can jump in increments greater than 1; this implies that if multiple reinitializers coexist in\n a contract, executing them in the right order is up to the developer or operator.\n WARNING: Setting the version to 2**64 - 1 will prevent any future reinitialization.\n Emits an {Initialized} event."
